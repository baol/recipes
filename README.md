A website where we store our home recipes to share with friends and family.

The website experiments with a super easy to use, but a bit tricky to setup, workflow that mixes:

- Obsidian and Drive shares - to allow any participant to edit or add new recipes
- mkdocs-material - to build the markdown file structure into a working website
- GitHub ad GitHub actions - to automate the publishing via GitHub pages on push

The folder structure is the following:

- The recipes in the `docs` folder are edited with Obsidian or with a text editor
- The `docs/Templates` folder contains the recipe template to start a new document in Obsidian or the text editor
- There are two separate indices, one for Obsidian that is autogenerated, and another one for mkdocs-material to generate the intro and tag index

## Obisdian and MkDocs interoperability

In general they coexist well if we use standard markdown, together with a simple preamble with tags.

As the two systems have slightly different features some care needs to be put into using only precise relative links. Obsidian is smart and will resolve images automagically, but not all markdown engines do the same. Using proper relative links (e.g. `../images/file.jpeg`) ensures compatibility across several scenarios: Obsidian, browsing the docs folder with other tools (e.g. [GitHub itself](https://github.com/baol/recipes/blob/main/docs/Basi/Cipolle%20sottaceto.md) or VS Code with Markdown preview), or MkDocs.

## Drive shares and GitHub

In general the two work quite well together, and allow every family member to edit the recipes on the phone or computer using Obsidian or other tools. While the _webmaster_ will from time to time create a list of commits and push them to GitHub, where _Actions_ to publish the website to _GitHub pages_ will do the rest.
